\begin{rExpSection}
    {\ys \& \dhero}
    {Senior Software Manager}
    {Oct 2016 - May 2023}
    {Istanbul/Turkey}
    {\ys is a food delivery leader in Turkey. Acquired by worldwide giant in the same sector, \dhero in 2015.
    \\During my 6+ years, I had the chance to work in many roles with different responsibilities.
    \\Had the privilege to work on multiple different projects, ranging from financial billing of whole \ys (both B2B and B2C) to Vendor Portal web applications that every business customer of the company used to run their business needs.}
\end{rExpSection}

\begin{rExpDetailsByTitle}
    {Senior Software Engineering Manager, \dhero}
    {Jun 2022 - May 2023}
    \item Owner of the Vendor Portal Operations domain consisting of three squads in Turkey.
    \item Managing two engineering managers who focus on vendor menu quality control \& vendor self service operations under VP Operations domain. 
    \item Leading \& managing Menu Self Service squad directly, a team responsible for the product that every \dhero food vendor worldwide uses to manage their food menus.
\end{rExpDetailsByTitle}

\begin{rExpDetailsByTitleDouble}
    {Senior Software Engineering Manager, \ys}
    {Jan 2022 - Jun 2022}
    {Software Engineering Manager, \ys}
    {Mar 2020 - Jan 2022}
    \item Engineering manager of 4 different squads in 2 different domains. 2 squads responsible for Vendor Portals and 2 squads responsible for billing applications.
    \item Grew the single squad of 5 person to 4 squads of 30 people in 2 domains. While accomplishing this; I've planned and implemented renewal of HR's IT hiring process from scratch and developed a career plan framework for my teammates.
    \item Transformed a 10 year old monolithic billing application into multiple microservices and separated B2B \& B2C businesses while doing so. This led to the success of transformation from \ys's in-house billing application to SAP based billing process during \ys's complete IT migration to \dhero.
    \item Worked as a core part of \ys's migration to \dhero. This included migration of 2 domains I've managed; consisting of documentation of both business \& technical requirements of 2 domains' products and also management of squads on developing missing requirements on \dhero's corresponding Vendor Portal product.
\end{rExpDetailsByTitleDouble}

\begin{rExpDetailsByTitle}
    {Software Architect}
    {Jul 2019 - Mar 2020}
    \item Worked as an unofficial, all hands Team Lead of 5 person squad.
    \item Migrated large Vendor Portal application from .NET 4 to .NET Core. Later, this led the success of an early time to market in Vendor Portal of \ys Mahalle project.
    \item Separated commission calculation business from the \ys's huge monolithic billing application to a single microservice. New microservice leveraged distributed architecture and a service bus layer which resulted in instant benefits: monthly commission calculation duration decreased from 8+ hours to 30min and the ability to micro manage single order commission errors. This milestone gave the billing domain proven reason to transform billing application to reformed and tightly scoped microservices and eventually led success to testable applications unlike previous monolithic including zero code tests.
    \item Started growing the team with new hires to satisfy drastically increasing business needs on both billing and the Vendor Portal applications.

\begin{rExpDetailsByTitle}
    {Senior Software Engineer}
    {Jan 2018 - Jul 2019}
    \item Orchestrated an organizational change in Backoffice domain that ended splitting an existing single squad to 2 different scoped teams. With this change, became a part of 3 person team working solely on billing related applications and Vendor Portal application.
    \item After this change; as a team, we started improving our coding standards and quality. We improved the team's Joel Test score from 6/12 to 10/12 over time.
    \item Fixed architectural problems preventing testability and later added coded tests to Vendor Portal and billing applications.
    \item Added staging for billing application which then let us pre-run monthly billing applications which drastically improved production run failures during billing period.
    \item Added automatic rule-checking microservice which was responsible for early identification of CRM errors that can prevent successful billing run. This servicei later will be the foundation of first separated microservice from the monolithic billing application.
\end{rExpDetailsByTitle}

\begin{rExpDetailsByTitle}
    {Software Engineer}
    {Oct 2016 - Jan 2018}

    \item Created build \& deployment flows on TFS for previously manually built, deployed and had no versioning projects for most of the projects developed and maintained by team.
    \item Reduced the extreme duration of \ys's monthly billing process run from 6+ days to 12 hours (which includes approval steps with real time wait times by human approvers)
